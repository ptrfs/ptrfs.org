# A peice about Minimalism
#### 07 July 2024

Almost a week ago from the time of writing, I switched to bspwm, a little but powerful window manager.

I showed it to my friends and the reaction was somewhat mixed. This was mainly down to the fact that the only module that is seen is the time, although I will change to show the current desktop I am on. I like this design, espcially with the fact that most designs or 'rices' as some call them on major forums such as unixporn nroamlly have contrasting colours and many modules that some people, like me, would not need for daily use. People, in retrun have said that my designs are 'minimalistic'. This is usual for me if you have seen my customisations, and even the landing page for this website! But I feel like minimalism these days have become more and more bastract and I felt like i would want to define what it is and why i like it so much.

In my opinion, The main goal of minimalism is to convey the most important information with the least available visual context. Now, Let's break this definition down; Minimalism is supposed to use elements clearly and effectively. This could mean a lot of things, does it mean that the website has to blunt? No. In other words, goal of most minimalist design is to inspire intrigue or a sense of agency from the viewer, despite if it looks non-discernible at first glance. Based on this principle, let us look at the token example of minimalism - [Warming Stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes) by Ed Hawkins. As i have just said, minimalism is supposed to convey a sort of emotion from the reader, with little spoon-feeding and superfluousness at the same time. The progression from blue, a colour that is normally found as a representation of life and calm to a rather violent red gives a sense of urgency about climate change, but at first look, it's looks like lines. This reinforces the point of giving much information about the content about a certain piece of information, while keeping it look like an entire manifesto.

I chose minimalist design as it is the best way to give a key identity to your media. Unlike bastract art, which is unintelligable and has so many conflicting viewpoints in it, minimalism focuses on one key element and builds around it to the best of its ability. It gives a higher sense of proffesionalism and fairness than other designs, which concentrate with multiple things being right for it to work. It feels as if you just need to focus on one key element, having emotion in that element and making the viewer interact with it. And with the internet giving way to all design philosophies, minimalism feels the most stable and comforting of the bunch. It doesn't feel like it has to be tinkered with and reworked to be the best possible thing imaginable, it is there, it works and embodies "if it waint broke, don't fix it". For me, i always viewed minimalism and a way to giving a sense of calm in my life, as in that if there is no distraction, i can actually focus on the main content.

Well, how do you perfrom minimalism in various forms of media? It basically boils down to a key point - "less is better". Focus on what the media needs and hide the non-essential elements in area that is accessable. Give each object space to breathe and keep the colour pallete the same. Typography is also important, you are using serif? Keep using serif. Sans-serif, use san-serif fonts everywhere. The fonts should also be able to interact with each other, but at the same time have thier own space. Each element has meaning, and each colour has to have a sort of balance to the overall balance.

I have to say, they are some downsides. Some websites could not pull of minimalist designs, like news news sites. The news has to put in a good area where people will actually click it, making actual minimlaism next to impossible. Also, sites that depend on user-generated images and text cannot pull off minimalism as you cannot moderate every single image to make it fit a few, stringent art rules. So do keep that in mind.

All i can leave with is the quote by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, a french aviator, poet and writer: *"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*
