    <h2># Why ptrfs.org exists</h2>
    <h4>07 July 2024</h4>

    <p>
      On the 6th of July, 2024, i went on to webdev trying to buy ptr.co.zw. It
      was a passion of mine to have it, and i was so close to obtaining. I
      *know* that I will have it eventually, but then, the reason why i couldn't
      get it was because the payment service only accepted Zimbabwe Gold -
      Zimbabwe's somewhat-new currency. I did not have ZiG, so i moved on to get
      ptr.org, well atleast i tried, until GoDaddy told me it was ~$50 for just
      the agent fee, bummer. After, i went on to discord to discuss with some of
      my online friends and they reccomended me to get __ptrfs.org__: It's
      cheap, especially for a website with only 8 characters, although the price
      does come down when you realise that they are no actual discernable words
      in it, and it is just a long version of my name - ptr.
    </p>

    <p>
      ptr.co.zw was mainly a passion project for me: A place where i could write
      articles without dealing with any services, a place where i could host my
      git repositories without having to worry about keeping them up-to-date, a
      wikipedia clone for a server that i play on, aand lastly a blog.
      Unfortunately, that has become more and more unfeasable because i dont
      have the time (and the budget) to do such things, so i just dropped it and
      made a new plan action that you will see later on in the article. I have
      been wanting a domain of my ownfor forever and when some things are long
      overdue for me, i just spring at them, no matter if it is a good idea or
      not, the list is very small, though and it is going to shrink, maybe the
      same will hapen with items that i want now in the future, who knows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before i can explain the new plan, i have to explain the old. My original
      plan of action of the website was to have all these different services
      running, right? Well, all those need a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">
        Virtual Private Server</a
      >. The TL;DR about it is that its basically a sever where you host
      everything on your website. Website hosting goes for a hefty penny, though
      and namecheap's Stellar plan, it's entry-level option costs $22 a year.
      That doesn't seem like alot, but for a person who has virtually no income
      streams, when i get money, i try to not put everything in one "basket".
      Next up was setting up internal services, which takes large amounts of
      time, time that i do not have: I have exams, i have extra-curricular
      activities that require <il>alot</il> of research, so actually having
      another baby to take care of did seems like the best idea ever.
    </p>

    <div>
      Well, what is ptr's plan for ptrfs.org, then? My idea can be broken down
      into three major categories:

      <ol>
        A blog page, which i can express my thoughts and write whatever comes in
        my brain - that is
        <code>bl</code
        >, what you are reading now.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        A news page, which i can write about everything that is happening, with
        little opinion - that is
        <code>nw</code>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        A preservation page, which i can store files that are hard of reach or
        not on the internet, this is going to recieve the least attention.
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
      Almost all of this is going to be sparatic, but i will try to have regular
      updates, except when i cannot and that would be due to major events that
      are going in my life. Blogs will be less standardised while the news page
      will have a set of rules tthat it should follow.
    </p>
    Why two different pages, though? This is mainly down to my views on how the
    media should operate. I believe that there should be a clear and obvious
    distiction between <b>news</b> - actual stories that have been reviewed,
    fact checked and gone under scrutiny and opinion articles, or as some people
    call them, think pieces, which normally just give judgement on what is going
    on at the time. What i am basically saying is that the blog is opinion while
    the news website is for, well, news! But i would like to promise you now.
    Any news peices that i make will be as neutral as humanly possible. It is
    not going to be <il>as</il> hard, due to the stuff that i am reporting on is
    parliamentary issues.

    <p>
      Well, why .org? When i think of the reasons to use .org i think of
      organisations that are trying to do good, profit-motivated or not. They
      usually do not have ads, it is less populist and more balanced. Ill give
      an example: <a href="https://stallman.org">stallman.org</a> is mostly seen
      as a personal blog for Richard Stallman. They are no products being sold,
      no swaying of opinion, it's just Richard Stallman raising opinion on
      certain issues he is passionate about. I am really a big fan of that, and
      wanted to do the same. To clarify i am not a fan of Richard Stallman's
      ideas, i just like the way he runs his website.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to have an online sopabox which i can voice my opinions on
      certain issues and not feel like i am forced to. I want to have a canvas
      where i show my art to everyone (not like actual art, though, i suck at
      drawing). The goal i have for ptrfs.org is to also be a store of
      information too obscure to be noticed by larger websites, like Wikipedia.
      I can have a plan where i feel no restrictions (other than GitHub TOS) to
      post whatever i want.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the major goals for ptrfs.org is to have a neutral source for
      Zimbabwean news. Most of not all Zimbabwean journalist instituitions are
      biased towards either the government or are mostly anti-government
      (looking at you, The Herald and NewsDay). This leaves little to not nuance
      in the Zimbabwean political spectrum and it is hurting the Democracy that
      we do have. What i have argued for is a balanced news source that does not
      aim to please a certain party or political group, but to actually bring
      factual and unbaised news, especially about the happenings in parliament.
    </p>

    <p>
      The future of this project entirely lies on the amount of people who are
      interested in it. If i do garnour some interest, i might scale up and make
      it bigger, not this year, though and lage parts of next year as i am
      trying to focus on school. If it does not gain an attention, it'll
      probably be on GitHub pages and act as a little passion project of mine. I
      will have a sort of online journal that i can just air out my opinions and
      write down what is happening in the wacky world of Zimbabwean government.
