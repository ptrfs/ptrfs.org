    <h1>The Science of Change</h1>
    <h4>18 July 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Change, in a historical sense, can be described as the actions of certain
      groups to alter political dynamics in a region due to a profound need to
      enact new policies. Change often arises predictably, as a result of
      accumulating issues that eventually necessitate a significant shift. For
      example, the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the United Kingdom was not a
      novel idea, but rather the culmination of multiple issues concerning
      Scotland and Scottish independence, which eventually coalesced into its
      own political entity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Change can also be unexpected, which I categorise into two types: Natural
      Unexpected Change and Unnatural Unexpected Change. Natural unexpected
      change is the kind that <em>might</em> occur, but we cannot be sure until
      it happens. There is no set timeline for it; we just know it will happen
      <em>eventually</em>. For instance, Rishi Sunak calling the
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election"
        >British General Election</a
      >. While it was known that Sunak would eventually call a general election,
      the timing was uncertain. Many anticipated it would happen in August, so
      when he called it in June, it took many by surprise. Similarly,
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_Joe_Biden_from_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election"
        >Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 Presidential Election</a>
      >, though <em>likely</em>, occurred without a definitive timeline, making
      it a significant event when it happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then there are truly unexpected events, such as the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Cuban-missile-crisis"
        >Cuban Missile Crisis</a
      >. No one knew that the Soviets were placing nuclear warheads in Cuba, and
      their discovery nearly triggered a war.
    </p>

    <p>
      Change is a constant in our lives, influencing everything from scientific
      advancements to new economic theories and businesses disrupting the status
      quo. It also drives societal shifts, such as increased acceptance of
      marginalised groups. Change is often propelled by specific groups
      challenging how they are governed. A prominent example is France, where
      the Ancien Régime's inability to represent a growing middle class led to
      the French Revolution. Change is crucial because it can reshape thinking
      for centuries. Gradual change, in particular, tends to have lasting
      effects. For example, following the fall of Nazi Germany, a poll revealed
      that some Germans preferred the previous authoritarian regime—not out of
      hatred or support for autocracy, but because the changes they had
      experienced before seemed better than the current state.
    </p>

    <p>
      While change itself may not be inherently historical, its methods often
      are. The invention of the printing press, for example, broke the monopoly
      of a literate elite over information, leading to widespread criticism of
      governments and eventually inspiring change. It enabled the global spread
      of new ideas, shaping the developmental theories we recognise today. The
      Industrial Revolution transformed industry and manufacturing, prompting
      demands for political reforms, such as the Reform Act of 1832 in Britain
      and the Zollverein in Germany, which eventually facilitated unification.
      Similarly, the radio accelerated the dissemination of ideas, fostering
      greater connectivity among people.
    </p>

    <p>
      What might change look like today? It’s hard to predict, but the internet
      has rapidly globalised communication and increased English language
      adoption worldwide. Combining the functions of the printing press and the
      radio, the internet fosters continuous invention and reinvention of
      political and economic theories. However, change can fail when imposed
      against the will of the people or executed too hastily, as seen in Hungary
      in 1956. Governments installed by external forces and used to oppress
      their citizens are unsustainable, as people desire autonomy. This also
      explains the failure of French Revolutions before Napoleon—they were
      short-lived, lacked popular support, and were often poorly executed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Change succeeds when it works within the existing system and is familiar
      and appealing to the majority, especially those in power. Successful
      change is realistic, goal-oriented, and accountable to the people who
      enable it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most effective way to enact change is through comprehensive,
      democratic, and far-reaching methods that allow people to adapt to the
      change while recognising its distinctiveness. This approach is evident in
      companies that improve their products incrementally rather than completely
      reinventing them. Reinvention can be costly and risks alienating users,
      leaving only the most dedicated supporters. While I am not suggesting
      governments should function like corporations, deliberate and democratic
      change tends to have a more lasting impact.
