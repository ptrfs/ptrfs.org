    <h1>The Science of Change</h1>
    <h4>18 July 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Change, as a concept in the historical sense, can be described as the
      action of certain groups of people to alter the state of politics in a
      region due to a profound need championed by that group to enact policy.
      Change can be expected, as it often results from the culmination of
      multiple issues that eventually lead to a significant shift. For example,
      the Scottish National Party (SNP) in the United Kingdom wasn't a new,
      novel idea, but rather the culmination of multiple issues regarding
      Scotland and Scottish independence, which then coalesced into its own
      party.
    </p>

    <p>
      Change can also be unexpected, which I categorize into two different
      types: Natural Unexpected Change and Unnatural Unexpected Change. Natural
      unexpected change is the kind that <em>might</em> happen, but we are never
      sure until it does. There's never a set date for when it will occur; we
      just know it will happen <em>eventually</em>. A couple of examples include
      Rishi Sunak calling the
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election"
        >British General Election</a
      >. We knew that Sunak would call a general election, but the timing was
      uncertain, with many estimating it would happen in August. When he called
      it in June, it took many by surprise, and his reasons remain somewhat of a
      mystery. Another example is the more recent development of
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_Joe_Biden_from_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election"
        >Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 Presidential Election</a
      >. While it was <em>likely</em> to happen, no one knew exactly when,
      making it a significant event when it did occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then there are truly unexpected events, such as the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Cuban-missile-crisis"
        >Cuban Missile Crisis</a
      >. No one knew that the Soviets were placing nuclear warheads in Cuba, and
      when it was discovered, it nearly triggered a war.
    </p>

    <p>
      Change is a constant in our lives, influencing everything from the
      advancement of science to new economic theories or businesses disrupting
      the current environment. It also extends to societal shifts, such as
      people accepting certain kinds of people. Change is primarily driven by
      the need of specific groups to alter the way they are governed. A common
      example is France, where the Ancien RÃ©gime's failure to represent a
      growing middle class led to the French Revolution. Change, therefore, is
      crucial because it can reshape the way people think for centuries to come.
      Gradual change, in particular, can have lasting impacts. For instance,
      after the fall of Nazi Germany, a poll revealed that some Germans
      preferred the previous authoritarian regime, not because they hated others
      or favored autocracy, but because the change they experienced before was
      perceived as better than the current one.
    </p>

    <p>
      While change itself may not be historical, its methods can be. The rise of
      the printing press, for example, challenged the control of information by
      a literate few, leading to widespread critique of governments and eventual
      change. It allowed new ideas to spread globally, shaping the theories of
      development we know today. The Industrial Revolution transformed industry
      and manufacturing, prompting demands for governmental change, as seen with
      the Reform Act of 1832 in Britain and the Zollverein in Germany, which
      facilitated the unification of the country. The radio further accelerated
      the spread of ideas, enabling faster communication over short distances
      and fostering greater connectivity among people.
    </p>

    <p>
      What will change look like now? It's difficult to say, but the
      proliferation of the internet has rapidly globalized communication and
      increased English language adoption worldwide. The internet combines the
      functions of the printing press and radio, leading to a steady invention
      and reinvention of political and economic theories. However, change can
      also fail. It fails when imposed against the will of the people and
      executed over a short time frame, as demonstrated by Hungary in 1956. A
      government installed by another, used to persecute its citizens, would
      never last, as people desire the freedom to make their own decisions. This
      also explains the failure of the French Revolutions before Napoleon; they
      were short, deliberate, and lacked popular support.
    </p>

    <p>
      Change succeeds when it is implemented within the existing system, is
      familiar and popular with the majority, especially those in power.
      Successful change is realistic, goal-oriented, and accountable to the
      people who enacted it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best way to enact change, therefore, is through comprehensive,
      democratic, and far-reaching methods that allow people to become familiar
      with the change while still feeling that it is different. This approach is
      evident in many companies that continue to improve their products without
      completely reinventing the wheel. Reinvention can be too costly and risks
      losing customer interest, leaving only the most dedicated fans onboard.
      While I'm not suggesting that governments should be run like companies,
      deliberate and democratic change tends to have a longer-lasting impact.
