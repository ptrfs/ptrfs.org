    <h1>A piece about Minimalism</h1>
    <h4>07 July 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Almost a week ago from the time of writing, I switched to bspwm, a little
      but powerful window manager.
    </p>

    <p>
      I showed it to my friends and the reaction was somewhat mixed. This was
      mainly down to the fact that the only module that is seen is the time,
      although I will change to show the current desktop I am on. I like this
      design, especially with the fact that most designs or 'rices' as some call
      them on major forums such as unixporn normally have contrasting colors and
      many modules that some people, like me, would not need for daily use.
      People, in return, have said that my designs are 'minimalistic'. This is
      usual for me if you have seen my customizations, and even the landing page
      for this website! But I feel like minimalism these days has become more
      and more abstract, and I felt like I would want to define what it is and
      why I like it so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my opinion, the main goal of minimalism is to convey the most important
      information with the least available visual context. Now, let's break this
      definition down; Minimalism is supposed to use elements clearly and
      effectively. This could mean a lot of things, does it mean that the
      website has to be blunt? No. In other words, the goal of most minimalist
      design is to inspire intrigue or a sense of agency from the viewer,
      despite it looking non-discernible at first glance. Based on this
      principle, let us look at the token example of minimalism -
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes"
        >Warming Stripes</a
      >
      by Ed Hawkins. As I have just said, minimalism is supposed to convey a
      sort of emotion from the reader, with little spoon-feeding and
      superfluousness at the same time. The progression from blue, a color that
      is normally found as a representation of life and calm to a rather violent
      red gives a sense of urgency about climate change, but at first look, it
      looks like lines. This reinforces the point of giving much information
      about the content of a certain piece of information, while keeping it
      looking like an entire manifesto.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose minimalist design as it is the best way to give a key identity to
      your media. Unlike abstract art, which is unintelligible and has so many
      conflicting viewpoints in it, minimalism focuses on one key element and
      builds around it to the best of its ability. It gives a higher sense of
      professionalism and fairness than other designs, which concentrate with
      multiple things being right for it to work. It feels as if you just need
      to focus on one key element, having emotion in that element and making the
      viewer interact with it. And with the internet giving way to all design
      philosophies, minimalism feels the most stable and comforting of the
      bunch. It doesn't feel like it has to be tinkered with and reworked to be
      the best possible thing imaginable, it is there, it works, and embodies
      "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". For me, I always viewed minimalism as a
      way to give a sense of calm in my life, as in that if there is no
      distraction, I can actually focus on the main content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, how do you perform minimalism in various forms of media? It
      basically boils down to a key point - "less is better". Focus on what the
      media needs and hide the non-essential elements in an area that is
      accessible. Give each object space to breathe and keep the color palette
      the same. Typography is also important, are you using serif? Keep using
      serif. Sans-serif, use sans-serif fonts everywhere. The fonts should also
      be able to interact with each other, but at the same time have their own
      space. Each element has meaning, and each color has to have a sort of
      balance to the overall balance.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have to say, there are some downsides. Some websites could not pull off
      minimalist designs, like news sites. The news has to be put in a good area
      where people will actually click it, making actual minimalism next to
      impossible. Also, sites that depend on user-generated images and text
      cannot pull off minimalism as you cannot moderate every single image to
      make it fit a few, stringent art rules. So do keep that in mind.

      All I can leave with is the quote by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, a French
      aviator, poet, and writer:
      <em
        >"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
        when there is nothing left to take away."</em
      >
