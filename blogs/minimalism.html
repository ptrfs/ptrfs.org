    <h1>A Piece About Minimalism</h1>
    <h4>07 July 2024</h4>

    <p>
      Almost a week ago from the time of writing, I switched to bspwm, a small
      but powerful window manager.

      I showed it to my friends, and the reaction was somewhat mixed. This was
      mainly due to the fact that the only module visible is the time, although
      I plan to change it to show the current desktop I am on. I like this
      design, especially considering that most designs, or 'rices' as some call
      them on major forums such as unixporn, typically feature contrasting colors
      and many modules that some people, like me, don't need for daily use.
      In return, people have said that my design is 'minimalistic.' This is
      common for me, if you've seen my customizations—and even the landing page
      for this website! But I feel like minimalism today has become increasingly
      abstract, and I wanted to take a moment to define what it is and why I
      appreciate it so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my opinion, the main goal of minimalism is to convey the most important
      information with the least amount of visual context. Let's break this down:
      minimalism is supposed to use elements clearly and effectively. This could
      mean a lot of things—does it mean the website has to be blunt? No. In other
      words, the goal of most minimalist designs is to inspire intrigue or a sense
      of agency from the viewer, even though it might appear non-discernible at
      first glance. Based on this principle, let’s look at the classic example of
      minimalism: 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes"
        >Warming Stripes</a>
      > by Ed Hawkins. As I mentioned, minimalism is meant to evoke an emotion
      from the viewer, without spoon-feeding them or adding unnecessary details.
      The progression from blue—a color often associated with calm and life—
      to a violent red creates a sense of urgency regarding climate change. But at
      first glance, it simply looks like lines. This reinforces the idea of conveying
      a wealth of information in a way that remains visually simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose minimalist design because it is the best way to give a distinct
      identity to your media. Unlike abstract art, which can be unintelligible and
      rife with conflicting interpretations, minimalism focuses on one key element
      and builds around it to the best of its ability. It conveys professionalism
      and fairness more effectively than other designs, which rely on multiple
      elements being just right for the design to work. It feels as if you only
      need to focus on one key element, giving it emotional depth and encouraging
      the viewer to interact with it. With the internet offering a variety of
      design philosophies, minimalism feels like the most stable and comforting.
      It doesn't require constant tinkering to be effective—it simply works, embodying
      the idea of "if it ain't broke, don’t fix it." For me, minimalism provides
      a sense of calm, as the lack of distractions allows me to focus on the main content.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, how does one apply minimalism across various forms of media? It boils
      down to one key principle: "less is better." Focus on what the media needs,
      and hide non-essential elements in an accessible space. Allow each element
      to breathe and maintain a consistent color palette. Typography is also important:
      if you're using serif fonts, stick to serif. If you're using sans-serif, use
      sans-serif fonts throughout. The fonts should be able to complement each other,
      while still having their own space. Every element must have purpose, and each
      color should balance with the overall design.
    </p>

    <p>
      I must mention that there are some drawbacks to minimalism. Some websites,
      such as news sites, may struggle with minimalist designs. News needs to be
      placed in prominent areas where people will actually click on it, making true
      minimalism nearly impossible. Similarly, sites that rely on user-generated
      content, such as images and text, cannot fully embrace minimalism since
      moderating every single image to fit a set of strict art rules is practically
      impossible. So, it's important to keep this in mind.

      I will leave you with a quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, a French aviator,
      poet, and writer:
      <em>
        "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when
        there is nothing left to take away."
      </em>
