    <h2>Void - 5 Oct, 2024</h2>
    <p>
      A world collapsing, yet feels the same<br>
      In search of relief from desparatiion, they write<br>
      To free themselves from the disparity of man<br>
      And the death of all things pure and holy.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Piety - 13 Oct, 2024</h2>
    <p>
      A day of reckoning, a day of charm<br>
      A day of pain, a day of harm<br>
      From an area, safe and serene<br>
      To a place of danger, hatred and quarantine.<br>
      <br>
      In the name of the lord, of whom thy know<br>
      A patron of him, if he was a man<br>
      But she was a woman, born and bred<br>
      Yet she caused harm, piety as her cause.<br>
      <br>
      No thing can justify<br>
      The harm that was caused in the name of those<br>
      That spread the message, of hope and peace<br>
      Being violated, by those who listen to it.<br>
      <br>
      That faithful day, when time stopped for him<br>
      A pain so great, inflicted upon him<br>
      Done by her, to put her name up top<br>
      Caused by ambiguity<br>
      He didnt know who she was referring to.<br>
      <br>
      Justified in her work, as she saw it fair and holy<br>
      She went back to her normal, as she saw it fit<br>
      She used the scripture, thinking it was right<br>
      And yet the trauma cause by her, pained him.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Spring - July? 2024</h2>
    <p>
      A box, confined beyond wonder<br>
      Lies a class, fearless and unbound<br>
      Constructed by tradition, forever certain<br>
      Here is a class, in wonder<br>
      <br>
      Mischeif, always hidden<br>
      Always reverberating<br>
      From dawn to dusk, it is active<br>
      A leviathan, tame in nature<br>
      <br>
      Appointed, a gatekeeper<br>
      Invisible, yet impactful<br>
      A way to delay, a way to start<br>
      He is silent, yet loud<br>
      <br>
      It all comes together, fair in shape<br>
      Connecting together, a jigsaw is formed<br>
      Different peices, coming together<br>
      A colourful piece, despite its flaws<br>
    </p>
