    <h1>AI.</h1>
    <h4>28 August, 2024</h4>
    <p>
      If you are reading this article, you are likely aware of the AI craze that
      has dominated discussions over the past few years. While the frenzy peaked
      in 2023, with ChatGPT making waves in the industry, it has since settled
      somewhat. Google also entered the scene with its own AI models, and Bing
      became surprisingly usable.
    </p>
    <p>
      That period of hype has passed, and now I can share my perspective. So,
      what is AI? In its broadest sense, AI refers to computers exhibiting
      intelligence. This might sound odd, given that we already have
      smartphones, smart TVs, and similar devices. However, the "smart" I am
      referring to involves computers demonstrating human-like intelligence. AI
      has been around for quite some time, even if it wasn’t always marketed as
      such. For example, algorithms like YouTube's recommendation system and
      Google's search ranking are forms of artificial intelligence. Similarly,
      language server protocols (LSPs) in coding environments can be considered
      a type of AI, as they understand and provide insights about codebases. The
      AI we see today is built on the same foundational concepts as these
      "invisible" AIs. The main difference is the rise of a specific kind of AI:
      Generative AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll delve deeper into Generative AI (Gen AI) later, but first, it’s
      important to understand why AI is so significant today. Initially, AI,
      when not presented as a product, was designed to perform simple tasks like
      calculations, video recommendations, and organisational functions. It was
      primarily a tool for automation—an unsurprising development as companies
      naturally adopt automation when it benefits them. Today’s AI, however, is
      more than that. It can generate text, code, images, and other creative
      outputs, transforming from a behind-the-scenes tool into a marketable
      product.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most prominent examples of AI as a product is Generative AI,
      which trains on data to produce new content such as text, images, or
      videos. Gen AI doesn’t just refine existing information; it creates "new"
      content. While AI research dates back to 1956, Generative AI gained
      mainstream attention with the launch of ChatGPT, which broke records by
      reaching 100 million users in just two months. Granted, factors like
      increased internet penetration and social media usage contributed to its
      rapid adoption, but it was still remarkable to witness the meteoric rise
      of Gen AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following ChatGPT, competitors emerged, notably Google’s Gemini. While
      Gemini was a strong offering, it lacked the fanfare of ChatGPT and often
      played second fiddle despite its potential advantages. Bing AI also
      entered the fray, effectively integrating ChatGPT-like capabilities with
      internet search—a direct response to Gemini’s use of Google’s search
      indexing. Other players like Anthropic’s Claude and Mistral have since
      joined the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, AI is a valuable tool. It excels at assisting with
      repetitive tasks and serves as a great resource for avoiding boilerplate
      work. AI is excellent for generating outlines, proofreading, and
      identifying errors in writing, storytelling, or coding. Features like
      text-to-speech are transformative, and tools like Google Photos’ AI
      editing capabilities demonstrate practical, everyday uses. Applications
      like Gemini Live and ChatGPT’s voice features are helpful for
      brainstorming and validating ideas. These are just a few examples of how
      AI is making life more convenient, and I hope its development continues to
      prioritise accessibility and utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, AI is not without its flaws. It can be slow, lacks logical
      reasoning, and struggles with understanding context and 3D spaces.
      Generative AIs like Gemini are often narrowly focused and incapable of
      handling intricate or nuanced tasks. Fundamentally, AI is a probabilistic
      system—designed to calculate the most likely response—and cannot replicate
      human nuance or emotional intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite its limitations, I remain optimistic about AI. It is a growing
      industry with tremendous potential. However, the field is plagued by
      over-hype. New products often flood the market, many of which are poorly
      conceived or exploitative, prioritising profits over genuine utility. This
      trend risks damaging public trust and slowing down meaningful progress.
      The ethical challenges posed by Generative AI also warrant serious
      attention. Issues such as the preservation of artists’ rights,
      misinformation (or "hallucinations"), and societal disruptions caused by
      AI must be addressed. For instance, unchecked AI-generated misinformation
      could lead to severe consequences, including social unrest or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like any emerging technology, AI is surrounded by hype, which often
      overshadows its actual impact. Consider the case of NVIDIA and the
      proliferation of AI-focused products. Many of these innovations are not
      yet viable, creating a speculative bubble reminiscent of the dot-com era.
      If this bubble bursts, it could result in significant job losses and set
      back the AI industry by decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, AI is a promising technology but, like all tools, it must
      be used judiciously. Overuse and exploitation could hinder its potential.
      I hope the industry matures in a way that prioritises safe, useful, and
      ethical implementations, ultimately benefiting humanity.
